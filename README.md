# Car-Price-Prediction
Given a dataset containing numerous rows and columns of specific details of
many automobiles like Number of Wheels, its Brand , Price of the car, Strokes,
Fuel used for the car, and its Horsepower and RPM etc. , we have to utilize some
Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the price of the automobile and determine
the accuracy of our predicted models.
